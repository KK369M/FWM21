In nations like India, rampant food wastage plagues streets and landfills, driven by excess from events and eateries. A proposed Android app aims to redirect surplus food to the needy, reducing waste and benefiting both donors and recipients. Volunteers play a crucial role in facilitating pickups and coordinating donations, ensuring efficient redistribution. Beyond food, the platform will extend aid through donations of clothing, utensils, and more. By fostering awareness and strategic initiatives, this project emphasizes the urgency of curbing wastage for sustainable consumption, food security, and environmental stability. Through collective action, it envisions a future where resources are utilized responsibly, fostering a more equitable and sustainable society.
